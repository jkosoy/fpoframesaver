#FPO Frame Saver

A ridiculously simple Processing sketch to save you time when you need a placeholder set of images.

------

### How To Use

It's pretty simple:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Crack open the PDE in Processing.
3. Edit the constant variables (all uppercase) to define the colors you'd like to use, FPO text to display, width and height, etc. If you don't want FPO text you can just set that string to "".
4. Run the processing sketch.

The screenshots will save to your sketch directory as PNG files. Processing will keep running long after the PNGs save out.
